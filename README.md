🧠 Project Overview

This project explores the long-term impact of climate variability on rice yields in Tamil Nadu and Telangana — two of India’s key rice-producing states. Over 28 years of district-level data (1990–2017) were analyzed to uncover how temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and agricultural inputs affect rice productivity.


📈 What Was Done

- Cleaned and preprocessed raw rice yield and climate datasets  
- Performed year-wise correlation analysis between rice yield and climate variables  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier inspection, and feature interactions  
- Visualized positive and negative impacts using infographics  
- Shared all insights via a public LinkedIn post


 🔍 Key Findings

- Temperature: Moderate warming occasionally helped yields in Telangana, but caused stress in Tamil Nadu  
- Rainfall: Both excess and deficit rainfall were linked to yield drops  
- Wind Speed: Often overlooked, but a contributor to extreme yield loss

🌱 Why It Matters

Climate volatility threatens the food security of millions. By uncovering how climate variables shape rice production, this work supports the development of climate-resilient agriculture in India.
